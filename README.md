## Interactive Python Program to Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Program Description
The terminal program (`bikeshare.py`) provides the user with options for exploring randomly selected bikeshare data from the first six months (January through June) of 2017 for three large U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.  After selection of the city and the time period of interest by the user, information is provided about the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations, trip duration statistics, and user statistics.  

To run the program, download and place the three data files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`) in the same directory with the program file `bikeshare.py`.  From the command line run the program file using Python:

`python bikeshare.py`

### Project History

This interactive Python program was created to fulfill the project requirement for the course **"Introduction to Python"** offered by Udacity as part of their **_Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program_**.  Udacity provided the three CSV data files as well as a template Python script.  (The original source of the data was the system provider Motivate.)  The tasks for the student were to create functions that load data, query the user, extract information, and calculate and return descriptive statistics based on user inputs.  The project was submitted to and approved by Udacity in November 2019.

This GitHub repository was forked from the Udacity template repository `udacity/pdsnd_github`.  Files were uploaded, commits made, and branches merged to demonstrate competence at using Git and GitHub as the project submission for Udacity's **"Version Control with Git"** course, also a part of the **_Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program_**.

The program was updated in 2022 to incorporate changes necessary for it to run successfully with updated versions of Python.
